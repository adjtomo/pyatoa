      "`Pyatoa` is a Python-based toolbox for misfit assessment in seismic tomography. `Pyatoa` was designed to facilitate automation within the adjoint tomography workflow by abstracting the following operations: data gathering, waveform standardization, preprocessing, time-windowing, misfit measurement, misfit assesment, and visualization. To accomplish this, `Pyatoa` is built ontop of the following Python packages.\n",
