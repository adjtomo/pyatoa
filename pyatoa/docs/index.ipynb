    "`Pyatoa` is a misfit quantification toolbox for the modern tomographer. It provides abstraction over key Python packages to facilitate data gathering, preprocessing, misfit analysis and visualization in a seismic tomography problem. The design of `Pyatoa` was inspired by `Obspy`, translating to a design ethos of rapid development, through scripting or shell interaction, and useful abstractions to accomplish tasks in tomography.\n",
