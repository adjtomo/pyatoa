Pyatoa
------

**Pythonâ€™s Adjoint Tomography Operations Assistant**

--------------

``Pyatoa`` is a Python-based toolbox for misfit assessment in seismic
tomography. ``Pyatoa`` was designed to facilitate automation within the
adjoint tomography workflow by abstracting the following operations:
data gathering, waveform standardization, preprocessing, time-windowing,
misfit measurement, misfit assesment, and visualization.

To accomplish this, ``Pyatoa`` is built ontop of the following Python
packages.

-  `Obspy: <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki>`__ to tackle seismic
   data handling and processing
-  `Pyflex: <https://krischer.github.io/pyflex/>`__ for automatic time
   window selection of waveform data
-  `Pyadjoint: <http://krischer.github.io/pyadjoint/>`__ to calculate
   waveform misfit and generate adjoint sources
-  `PyASDF: <https://seismicdata.github.io/pyasdf/>`__ for efficient,
   hierarchical, self-describing storage of seismic data
-  `Pandas: <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ to simplify data aggregation
   and misfit assessment
