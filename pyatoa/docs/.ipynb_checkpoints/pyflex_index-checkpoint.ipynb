    "* The water/acceptance level of the data fit criteria is now evaluated at the center of each windows and not at the central peak.\n",

    "Instead of using the overlap resolution strategy outlined in section **2.5 Stage E** in the `FLEXWIN` paper, `Pyflex` utilizes weighted interval scheduling which is a classical IT problem. The weighted interval scheduling algorithm finds the best possible subset of non-overlapping windows by maximizing the cumulative weight of all chosen windows. By default the weight of each window is its length in terms of minimum period of the data times the maximum cross correlation coefficient. The weighting function can be overwritten with the help of the Config object. This results in similar windows to the original `FLEXWIN` algorithm but is easier to reason about.\n",
