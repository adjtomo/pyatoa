    "## Receiver codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Receivers can be identified multiple ways in the workflow. Most of the time when Pyatoa asks the user to identify a receiver, it will be through its __code__:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  __CODE__: The full SEED standard code __NN.SSS.LL.CCC__ (where __N__=Network, __S__=Station, __L__=Location, __C__=Channel); e.g. [NZ.BFZ.10.HHZ](https://www.geonet.org.nz/data/network/sensor/BFZ)  \n",
    "> **_wildcards_**: \n",
    "Wildcards are accepted and encouraged when specifying full codes. For example, in data gathering, selecting all available components is accomplished by specifying code NZ.BFZ.10.HH?, where the ? character is a single-valued wildcard.\n",
    "*  __NET / NETWORK__: Two character network code __NN__; e.g. NZ\n",
    "*  __STA / STATION__: Multi (3 or 4) character station code __SSS__: e.g. BFZ\n",
    "*  __LOC / LOCATION__: Two digit location code, for receiver sites that have multiple instruments (e.g. borehole and surface broadbands). e.g. 10\n",
    "> **_unknown location code_**: \n",
    "In my experience, location naming is not standard across data services. It is usually acceptable to provide wildcards to avoid having to determine the specific location code, e.g. NZ.BFZ.??.HH?\n",
    "*  __CHA / CHANNEL__: Three character channel code __BIO__ (where __B__=Band code, __I__=Instrument code, __O__= Orientation code), e.g. HHZ\n",
    "> **_seed convention_**: \n",
    "When saving new data, band code is enforced via the data sampling rate, following the format of the [SEED convention](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/seed-channel-naming/).\n",

As with iterations, the Config class keeps track of step count information for internal tagging.\n",
