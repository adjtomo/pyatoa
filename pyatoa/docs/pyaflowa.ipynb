    "Pyaflowa is Pyatoa's workflow management class. It is in charge of facilitating automation of misfit quantification using the underlying machinery defined by the Config, Manager and Gatherer classes. Pyaflowa provides a structure to process en-masse waveform data from multiple stations and multiple events using only a few function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyaflowa can be used standalone in conjunction with SPECFEM3D, and also provides with SeisFlows. When used within the SeisFlows preprocess module, Pyaflowa reduces the overhead required to include Pyatoa functionality into a SeisFlows inversion.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's start with an example of running Pyaflowa standalone, e.g. if you are simply trying to retrieve an event-specific sensitivity kernels using the machinery of SPECFEM3D Cartesian, then you would need to compare observed and synthetic waveforms using misfit quantification, and output adjoint sources that SPECFEM3D will use in its adjoint simulation. Let's walk through step by step.\n",

This means that multiple events can be processed in parallel, potentially allowing for large speed up when running waveform processing. We'll include another event [2012p242656](https://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/2012p242656), in our work directory and show how simple it is to use this functionality."
