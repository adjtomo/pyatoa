# CHANGELOG

## v0.2.1

- Updated internal call structures to deal with Pyadjoint v0.2.1 API changes
- Changed internal test ASDFDataSet and created a script to generate new dataset
  because the old one had no way of being remade.
- New Docs + Example + Example data: Processing data with Pyatoa and MPI
- Remove GitHub Pip install links for PySEP, Pyflex and Pyadjoint
