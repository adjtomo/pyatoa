## For Version X.Y.Z
- [ ] Proper docs for all functions. methods, classes 
- [ ] Finish writing tests with PyTest
- [ ] Initialize an empty Manager with an empty Config to remove the need to call Config separately
- [ ] Move all hardcoded stuff into plugins, e.g. fault_coordinates, geonet_moment_tensor
- [ ] Move window by amplitude into its own function
- [ ] Check if convolve_stf properly performs the time shift
