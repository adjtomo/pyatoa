Overview
==============

Pyatoa is a waveform assessment package designed to compare one set of wiggles
to another set of (similar) wiggles. Core functionalities of the package are:

- Waveform standardization and preprocesing
  (with `Obspy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/>`__)
- Time windowing (with `Pyflex <https://krischer.github.io/pyflex/>`__) and
  adjoint source generation (with
  `Pyadjoint <http://krischer.github.io/pyadjoint/>`__)
- Hierarchical data storage of waveforms, metadata, and measurements
  (with `PyASDF <https://seismicdata.github.io/pyasdf/>`__)
- Bulk measurement aggregation and analysis
  (with `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__)
- Waveform and measurement plotting
- Built-in interface with the automated workflow tool:
  `SeisFlows <https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows>`__

**In a nutshell**: Provide two similar waveforms and some configuration
parameters, receive misfit windows and adjoint sources. Do this in bulk and
analyze all returned misfit in aggregate.

Why is Pyatoa necessary?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Pyatoa simply wraps a number of already-working dependencies, why
do we need it?

Pyatoa acts in liue of the inevitable collection scripts a User would
have to write to link the data collection capabilities of ObsPy with the
windowing functions of Flexwin/Pyflex with the adjoint source generation of
Pyadjoint.

It also provides internal checks along the way to make sure you're not feeding
it garbage, and provides useful routines for performing and understanding
seismic inversions.

What doesn't Pyatoa do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pyatoa does not: generate sythetic waveforms, interface with HPC systems,
gather seismic data. These capabilities are supplemented by other packages,
some of which are hosted within the `adjTomo <https://github.com/adjtomo/>`__
ecosystem.

Recommended tools to use with Pyatoa:

- Gather seismic data: `PySEP <https://github.com/adjtomo/pysep>`__
- Generate synthetics: `SPECFEM <https://github.com/specfem>`__
- Automate inversions on HPCs: `SeisFlows <https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows>`__


How do (I use) Pyatoa?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pyatoa was written following the design philosophy of ObsPy i.e., called
through a Python interface or within Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks or other
Python packages. That is:

.. code:: python

    from pyatoa import Manager

    mgmt = Manager()
